# Campus
Simulated College Campus of Students that Interacts with Environment, School Project written in C++

## What is it?
This is a class assignment that I made for my programming class. In this class I learned many topics in C++ such as how to define and implement a class and use fundamentals of 
object-oriented design. With much practice with the assignments and projects completed in the class, I was able to create Campus, a simulated
campus containing interacting objects.

## How does it work?
A simulated Campus will contain a random amount of students that wander around. There is trash on Campus that the students will try to pick-up. The students
can also enter classroom buildings where there will be a teacher located inside. This teacher will assign each student a grade based on
the quantity of trash the students pickup. When all studnets have recieved a grade, one student will be nominated as the winner with the "MOST INTELLIGENT STUDENT AWARD".
